## Overview

[WithAI](https://www.getwith.ai) makes it easier than ever before to automate tasks using AI agents, whether you are engaging with community on social networks, making travel plans or reservations, or purchasing products. 

WithAI supports the apps you already use, including:
- **Social Networks**: Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, WhatsApp, LinkedIn
- **Travel**: Uber, Lyft, Delta, United
- **Reservations**: OpenTable, Resy, Yelp
- **Shopping**: Amazon, Instacart
- **Productivity**: Github 

<Tip>
WithAI uses [Anon](https://anon.com) to securely store user credentials, ensuring that only the specific action requested by the user is performed and the user can revoke access to applications at any time.

## Integrate Anywhere With Simple URLs

WithAI is designed so that simple URLs can be used to direct users to AI agents with context about the exact task to be automated.

## How It Works 

WithAI is used in three simple steps: 

<Steps>
  <Step title="Choose an Agent Template">
    Users can choose an agent template from the WithAI website, or are directed to an agent template from a shared URL.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure the Agent Template">
    The agent template is customized with details about what exactly it should do on behalf of the user. This information can optionally be included in links to pre-configure agents.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Sign Into App and Run Agent">
    Once the user has finalized their agent configuration, they sign into their account on the app being used by the agent so the agent can perform automated actions on their behalf.
  </Step>
</Steps>
