## Overview

WithAI makes it easier than ever before to automate tasks using AI agents, whether you are engaging with community on social networks, making travel plans or reservations, or purchasing products. 

WithAI supports the apps you already use, including:
- Social Networks: Instagram, X, Facebook, LinkedIn
- Travel: Delta, United, Uber, Lyft
- Reservations: OpenTable, Resy, Yelp
- Shopping: Amazon, eBay, Walmart, Target

Using the formatting guidelines included in this documentation, apps and chatbots can construct links for pre-configured agents to perform actions on behalf of users. 

Once the user has finalized their agent configuration, they sign into their account on the app being used by the agent so the agent can perform automated actions on their behalf.


<Tip>
WithAI uses [Anon](https://anon.com) to securely store user credentials, ensuring that only the specific action requested by the user is performed and the user can revoke access at any time.
