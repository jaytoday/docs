## Overview

[WithAI](https://www.getwith.ai) makes it easier than ever before to automate tasks using AI agents, whether you are engaging with community on social networks, making travel plans or reservations, or purchasing products. 

WithAI supports the apps you already use, including:
- **Social Networks**: Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, WhatsApp, LinkedIn
- **Travel**: Uber, Lyft, Delta, United
- **Reservations**: OpenTable, Resy, Yelp
- **Shopping**: Amazon, Instacart
- **Productivity**: Github 

Using the formatting guidelines included in this documentation, apps and chatbots can construct links to pre-configured agents that can perform  actions on behalf of users. 

## How It Works 

WithAI is used in three simple steps: 

<Steps>
  <Step title="Choose an Agent Template">
    Users can choose an agent template from the WithAI website, or can be directed to a specific agent template from a share link. 
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure the Agent Template">
    The agent template is customized with details about what exactly it should do on behalf of the user. This configuration can optionally be included in the share link constructed by an app or chatbot. 
  </Step>
  <Step title="Sign Into App">
    Once the user has finalized their agent configuration, they sign into their account on the app being used by the agent so the agent can perform automated actions on their behalf.
  </Step>
</Steps>


<Tip>
WithAI uses [Anon](https://anon.com) to securely store user credentials, ensuring that only the specific action requested by the user is performed and the user can revoke access at any time.
