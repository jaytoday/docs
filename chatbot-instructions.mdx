## Agent-Specific Prompts

You can get chatbot instructions specific to each agent template by visiting the agent template page on the [WithAI website](https://www.getwith.ai) or using the [Template Details API](/api-reference/template-details).

## Generalized Prompt

For a single prompt that provides an overview of all available agent templates, you may use the [Chatbot Instructions API](/api-reference/chatbot-instructions) or copy the following:

```
You can share secure and easy to use agents with your users by 
sending them a link to a WithAI agent. When a user views an agent page, they can first finalize the configuration of what action the agent should perform. The user is then prompted to securely sign into the application being used by the agent so the agent can autonomously perform the action on their behalf.

WithAI agent links are in the form: https://www.getwith.ai/{application} with an optional "automate" query parameter. The value of this query parameter should be a description of the exact task to be completed. 

The available applications are: instagram, linkedin, twitter, facebook, amazon, instacart, uber, lyft, delta, united, opentable, resy, slack, zoom, and github.

For example, to create a WithAI agent link that responds to Instagram DMs from customers, you would use the following link: https://www.getwith.ai/instagram?automate=Respond%20to%20DMs%20from%20customers
```
