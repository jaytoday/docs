## Specifying a Task to Automate

If you have a description of the task to automate but don't know the specific app that should be used to automate the task, you can link to the WithAI website with the task description as the `automate` query parameter with a URL-encoded value:

```json
https://getwith.ai?automate=Respond%20to%20customers
```
## Specifying an App to Use For Automation

If you know the app to use for an automation but don't know the specific task to automate, you can link to the WithAI website with a supported app name in the path:

```json
https://getwith.ai/instagram
```


## Specifying an App and Task to Automate

If you know the task to automate and the app to use for the automation, provide both the app name in the path and the task description as the `automate` query parameter:

```json
https://getwith.ai/instagram?automate=Respond%20to%20customers
```
